# PyXlR8
extending python with c within python function.
PyXLR8 is a Python library that allows users to seamlessly write, compile, and execute C code directly within Python scripts. It provides an easy-to-use interface for compiling C code snippets, making it ideal for projects that require the integration of C code functionality into Python applications making the program faster. 
Python function with c-code snippets in function doc strings allows the function to be compiled directly and the function is changed in global namespace to foregin function that calls a dynamically linked shared object. The C compiler flags and optimization levels can be controlled. 

#Features
1.Simple Integration: Easily embed C code within Python scripts.

2.Compilation: Compile C code directly from Python.

3.Execution: Execute compiled C code and capture output.

4.Error Handling: Handle compilation errors and exceptions gracefully.

5.Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
